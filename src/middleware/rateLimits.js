/*
 * Rate-limit middleware for credential-bearing public endpoints.
 *
 * The page POST /login already has an IP-based brute-force limiter in
 * controllers/main.js. The API surfaces below were unprotected — anyone
 * could hammer /api/v1/login (PWA + mobile auth) at full speed. This
 * module supplies reusable limiters and a thin Express wrapper.
 *
 * Limits are intentionally generous for a single legitimate user (forgot
 * password → a few retries) but cut off automated dictionary attacks.
 *
 * Storage: persisted in MongoDB (rate-limiter-flexible's RateLimiterMongo)
 * so the counter survives container restarts — Watchtower deploys a fresh
 * Trudesk container every few days, and an in-memory limiter would reset
 * the brute-force budget on every redeploy. A RateLimiterMemory is wired
 * up as insuranceLimiter so that a brief Mongo outage doesn't fail-open
 * completely.
 *
 * Skipped when NODE_ENV === 'test' so the existing Mocha suite keeps
 * passing without per-test state leaking between cases. The
 * 'unit-test-enforce' path in rateLimits.test.js exercises the real
 * limiter; because Mongoose isn't connected in unit tests, the lazy
 * lookup falls back to the in-process memory limiter — which is exactly
 * what those tests assert against.
